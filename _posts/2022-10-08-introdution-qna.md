## About Us

The IntEMD Lab. at DUT focused on intelligent equipment and smart medical devices for various fields with (1) Multidisciplinary Design and Optimization, (2) Digital Twins with Novel Sensing System, (3) Medical Device Design and Manufacturing, and (4) Neuro biomechanics.

For the intelligent equipment field, we investigate the theory and technology in multi-sensor fusion and mechanics modeling toward the next-generation technology of digital twins in aerospace and industry applications.

For the intelligent medical device field, we study the basic neuromusculoskeletal mechanisms of coordinated movement of humans by applying neurobiochemical modeling and electrophysiological signal processing. Our goal is to develop neuromusculoskeletal digital twin and offer a powerful tool for precision medicine of neuromuscular and musculoskeletal disorders.

## Postdoc Position
